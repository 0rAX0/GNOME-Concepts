GNOME Concepts
=====================
###An idea bank.

Here's the current situation, GNOME Shell is awesomely extensible but there are a few (as in 'OMG! What a good idea!') extensions appearing, why?

It could be that GNOME Shell is not as extensible as I think. But it's highly likely that the 3rd-party devs have no idea on what to do with it besides bringing GNOME2-era features like menus and indicators. That's when I and the rest of us come into the picture, what if we put all of our good ideas in a single place so developers who want to work on a new cool extension can choose one and start working on it? No duplicate efforts. No frustration. Everybody wins.

I hope this solves the issue.ï»¿

##How to submit ideas

To submit your idea(s) you can [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repo and commit whatever you have and send a pull request. If you don't want to deal with Git, [email me](mailto:the.red.shortcut@gmail.com).

##How to start working on a project

Great! You've seen an idea and you'd like to make it happen, you're awesome! First, you need to ckeck the [status](https://github.com/0rAX0/GNOME-Concepts/wiki/Status) to see if it is availble for you to work on; if it's not then you can always help the existing developer(s) maintain and improve their work, you know how this works. If it _is_ available, then make sure you change the status in the Wiki page and provide a link to your repo so people can follow. 
One more thing, if you don't or can't work on your project anymore please make sure you update the Wiki page so someone else can take over. And thank you for your work. :)

##How to report bugs

To report a new issue, add the prefix [Idea #N] and a descriptive title. Then it's just yet another bug report, right? ;)

##FAQ

**Q: I have a plenty of super ideas to submit but I can't make fancy mockups, what do I do?**

A: You can draw them however you like. You can also discribe it with text and I or someone else will try to draw it for you. But please try to make whatever you submit as clean and clear as possible.

**Q: I'm a developper and I want to take an idea and make it availble upstream instead of making an extension, is that possible?**

A: Yep. See `How to start working on a project` above and do everything it says, and instead of linking to a repo add a link to your Bugzilla report and update the Wiki page when your patch is committed upstream. 

**Q: We are a distro/GS fork, can we take ideas from here?**

A: Of course, but if you're based on GNOME Shell please make the ideas you work on available for the rest of us; either by sending patches upstream or by making extensions. If you're a distro (i.e. not using GS/fork) do mention us, please. ;)

**Q: Some ideas seem incomplete or too complex to be presented by two images, is that intended?**

A: Yes. It is intended in a sense that this repo only contains the ideas, which are open for discussion and/or expansion. Discussions and suggestions are welcome.

**Q: I disagree with some ideas, what can I do?**

A: Report a bug (see above), mentioning the idea's #number and propose your superior solution or whatever.
