##How to submit ideas

To submit your idea you can [Fork!](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repo and commit whatever you have and send a pull request. If you don't want to deal with Git [email me!](mailto:the.red.shortcut@gmail.com).

##FAQ

**Q: I have a plenty of super ideas to submit but I can't make fancy mockups, what do I do?**

A: You can draw them however you like. You can also discribe it with text and I or someone will try to draw it for you. But please try to make whatever you submit as clean and clear as possible.


**Q: We are a distro/GS fork, can we take ideas from here?**

A: Of course, but if you're based on GNOME Shell please make the ideas you work on available for the rest of us; either by sending patches upstream or by making extensions. If you're a distro (i.e. not using GS/fork) do mention us, please. ;)

**Q: I disagree with some ideas, what can I do?**

A: Report a bug (see above), mentioning the idea's #number and propose your superior solution or whatever.
